# Event Dispatcher
Service responsible for reading the buffers from the pre-processor and send them to the correct content extraction based on the Control Flow received by the Query Planner.

# Commands Stream
## Inputs
### addBufferStreamKey
```json
{
    "action": "addBufferStreamKey",
    "buffer_stream_key": "buffer-stream-key",
    "publisher_id": "44d7985a-e41e-4d02-a772-a8f7c1c69124"
}
```

### delBufferStreamKey
```json
{
    "action": "delQuery",
    "buffer_stream_key": "buffer-stream-key"
}
```
### updateControlFlow
```json
{
    "action": "updateControlFlow",
    "control_flow": {
        "some-publisher-id-1": [
            ["dest1", "dest2"],
            ["dest3"],
            ["graph-builder"]
        ],
        "other-publisher-id-2": [
            ["dest1"],
            ["dest3"],
            ["graph-builder"]
        ]
    }
}

```
## Outputs

# Data Stream

Annotate the input data events with the following fields:
```json
{
    "data_flow": [
            ["dest1", "dest2"], // first step
            ["dest3"],          // second step
            ["graph-builder"]   // final step
        ],
    "data_path": [],
}
```
Where, data_flow is the complete data-flow for this event.
And data_path is the ongoing process (whenever it gets into a new destination in the data-flow, it will update data_path, in order to have the current destination in there).
The data events are dispatched to the destinations in the first step on the dataflow.


# Installation

## Configure .env
Copy the `example.env` file to `.env`, and inside it replace `SIT_PYPI_USER` and `SIT_PYPI_PASS` with the correct information.

## Installing Dependencies

### Using pipenv
Run `$ pipenv shell` to create a python virtualenv and load the .env into the environment variables in the shell.

Then run: `$ pipenv install` to install all packages, or `$ pipenv install -d` to also install the packages that help during development, eg: ipython.
This runs the installation using **pip** under the hood, but also handle the cross dependency issues between packages and checks the packages MD5s for security mesure.


### Using pip
To install using pip directly, one needs to use the `--extra-index-url` when running the `pip install` command, in order for to be able to use our private Pypi repository.

Load the environment variables from `.env` file using `source load_env.sh`.

To install from the `requirements.txt` file, run the following command:
```
$ pip install --extra-index-url https://${SIT_PYPI_USER}:${SIT_PYPI_PASS}@sit-pypi.herokuapp.com/simple -r requirements.txt
```

# Running
Inside the python environment (virtualenv or conda environment), run:
```
$ ./event_dispatcher/run.py
```

# Testing
Run the script `run_tests.sh`, it will run all tests defined in the **tests** directory.

Also, there's a python script at `./event_dispatcher/send_msgs_test.py` to do some simple manual testing, by sending msgs to the service stream key.


# Docker
## Build
Build the docker image using: `docker-compose build`

**ps**: It's required to have the .env variables loaded into the shell so that the container can build properly. An easy way of doing this is using `pipenv shell` to start the python environment with the `.env` file loaded or using the `source load_env.sh` command inside your preferable python environment (eg: conda).

## Run
Use `docker-compose run --rm service` to run the docker image
